The Code Breaker kata

The secret contains 4 colours out of green, blue, cyan, red and yellow.
In the simple setup, repititions of the same colour are not allowed.

The secret is written as string with a letter for each colour separated with space (e.g. "r g b y").

For a guess in the same format, the solution should return a string with a 
'p' for every match of colour and position, and a
'm' for every other colour contained in the secret.

See features/CodeBreaker.feature for the acceptance tests.
To run the acceptance tests, uncomment the assert in test CodeBreakerSteps and run Cucumber
by using "cucumber" in the sbt shell.


Another challenge is to allow douplets in secret and guess. The features directory contains
a Cucumber specification for that. Rename the file to make Cucumber run it, as well.
